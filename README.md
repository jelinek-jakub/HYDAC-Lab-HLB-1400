## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **HSP Protocol Implementation**: Decodes and handles requests and responses based on the Hydac Simple Protocol (HSP) / RS485.
- **Request Types**:
  - `Id`: Retrieves the sensor's identification information.
  - `Status`: Obtains the current operational status of the sensor.
  - `Data`: Fetches real-time oil condition data.
- **Data Decoding**: Requests and responses were captured via a COM analyzer and decoded due to the lack of available online documentation.

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller e.g.**: ATmega328 (Arduino UNO), ESP32 (ESP32 DevKitC), RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico), ..
- **RS485 Transceiver**: e.g., MAX485 or similar module
- **Connections**:
  - Connect the RS485 module to the ESP32 UART pins.
  - Ensure proper termination and biasing for RS485 communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

- Upon successful communication, the program will retrieve and display sensor data such as saturation level, temperature, dielectric constant, and electrical conductivity.
- Consider integrating with a display or logging system to visualize and store the retrieved data.
